UIOMux Release 1.5.0
====================

UIOMux is a conflict manager for system resources, including UIO devices.

The source archive, and more information about the library are available from:

	http://oss.renesas.com/modules/document/?libuiomux

This release of libuiomux targets Renesas SH-Mobile processors.

New in this release
-------------------

This release adds a function to convert a virtual address to it's corresponding
physical address. This function covers all memory allocated via UIOMux for the
current process. Also, new functions have been added to register and unregister
blocks of memory that can be used by the resources. This allows memory, such as
the frame buffer, that can be accessed by all resources (e.g. hardware IP blocks)
to be registered with UIOMux and hence included in the virt to phys address look
up.

Additonally, a Renesas specific resource has been added for the Camera ISP.
