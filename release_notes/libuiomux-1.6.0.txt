UIOMux Release 1.6.0
====================

UIOMux is a conflict manager for system resources, including UIO devices.

The source archive, and more information about the library are available from:

This release of libuiomux targets Renesas SH-Mobile processors.

New in this release
-------------------

This release adds functions to list all resource names and allow the client to
open a named resource. This allows UIOMux to open specific hardware resources
that were previously inaccessible (e.g. a second VEU). With the complications
of multiple similar resources whose capabilites differ only in performance or
supported sizes, it was felt that explicit control over access to the resource
is best.

Changes
-------

This release includes the following changes since version 1.5.0:

Takanari Hayama (4):
      New API to open IP blocks only those specified by callers explicitly.
      support up to 64MB UIO memory.
      Support resources that only need registers mapped.
      use directory listing and cache results when scanning /sys/class/uio/.

      docs: Fix doxygen comments for API
