UIOMux Release 1.3.0
====================

UIOMux is a conflict manager for system resources, including UIO devices.

The source archive, and more information about the library are available from:

This release of libuiomux targets Renesas SH-Mobile processors.

New in this release
-------------------

This release replaces shared memory with flock and fcntl. The main driver for
this is Android's different take on shared memory. Instead of using mutexes
stored in shared memory, this release locks using flock. Also, instead of using
shared memory to store information on used UIO memory, this release use fcntl
to lock the UIO file accordingly.

In addition to these changes, this release adds a function to allocate shared
UIO memory (uiomux_malloc_shared). This only supports a single shared memory
region for each UIO device.
